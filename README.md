# About

Running a marathon is hard. Setting up your training plan shouldn't be.

1. Set the date of your race
2. Pick a plan
3. Choose miles or kilometers
4. Download the plan and add it to your calendar

It really is that easy. [Get started now!](https://www.codyhoover.com/time-to-run)

This project takes inspiration from ["Calendar Hack"](https://defy.org/hacks/calendarhack/about/) by [@defyorg](https://twitter.com/defyorg) which I've already used for multiple marathons.

This project includes a few popular training plans from [Advanced Marathoning](http://www.amazon.com/Advanced-Marathoning-Edition-Pete-Pfitzinger/dp/0736074600) by Pete Pfitzinger and Scott Douglas, [Faster Road Racing](https://www.amazon.com/Faster-Road-Racing-Half-Marathon/dp/1450470459) by Pete Pfitzinger and Philip Latter, [Hansons Marathon Method](https://hansons-running.com/collections/hansons-swag/products/hansons-method-hansons-method-mara%22) by Kieth and Kevin Hanson, and [Marathon: The Ultimate Training Guide](http://www.amazon.com/Marathon-Ultimate-Training-Programs-Marathons/dp/1609612248) by Hal Higdon. The plans are not intended to be used on their own and should be used in combination with the books, so please support the authors (and yourself!) if you don't already own them.
